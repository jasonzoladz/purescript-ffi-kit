# purescript-ffi-kit
A comprehensive set of FFI conveniences for PureScript in a single module.

This is a collection of the most useful FFI conveniences I've found
in the PureScript community.  When you're wrapping a library, it's helpful
to have them all in one place.  (Credit is due to @garyb. @hdgarrood,
@hoodunit, and others.)
In particular, the `runThisFn*` and `runThisEff*` series are time savers.
